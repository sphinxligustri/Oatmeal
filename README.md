# Oatmeal
Life hack - cooking for one.

How much water is needed is deterministic and when you get a hang of it, it's a breeze.

When working from home, I prepare this around breakfast, and eat it for lunch. For someone, "executively dysfunct", like me it's a go-to recipe for carrying me through the afternoon. 

I haven't yet tried, but you could prepare it at home and bring it on a hike. Just make sure it doesn't spill in your backpack.

You need
* Ingredients - make you own recipe!
* Insulated food jar of right size - depends on your appetite.
* Hot water - I use an electric kettle.
* I like to add frozen fruits when it's ready.
